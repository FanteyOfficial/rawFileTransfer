# RawFileTransfer

## To create the exe file:
```cmd
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile RawFileTransferGUI.py
```
#### You can add the ```--noconsole``` attribute but for some reasons antivirus will cry

## How works?
- Select the main folder where you have all photos (.jpg and .raw files)
- Select the destination folder where you have only the .jpg files to transfer .raw files in the same folder
